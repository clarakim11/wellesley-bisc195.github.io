Calculates the GC ratio of a DNA sequence.
The GC ratio is the total number of G and C bases divided by the total length of the sequence.
For more info about GC content, see here:

Example
≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡≡

    julia> gc_content("AATG")
    0.25

    julia> gc_content("cccggg") * 100
    100.0

    julia> gc_content("ATta")
    0.0
